UniAxis Control Component
=========================

UniAxis is a CraftyJS (http://craftyjs.com) component that implements a 4 way control method allowing moving in a single direction at a time.

Usage is like any other control component. The only accepted argument is the speed that the entity is to be moved in.

var Player = Crafty.e("UniAxis").uniaxis(2);
